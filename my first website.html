								3G: The next thing down from WiFi in performance is the 3G (Third Generation) mobile phone network. The speed can approach WiFi, but is much more variable. 3G access may also be restricted in terms of the amount of data a mobile device is allowed to transfer, and there may be charges to use this connectivity. GPRS: In many areas 3G network coverage is not available. The phone will then fall back to the GPRS mobile network, which is much slower.  The networking abilities are exposed as TCP/IP connections (we will explore what this means later in the text). Unfortunately, as you will have undoubtedly experienced, network coverage is not universal, and so software running on the phone GPRS mobile network, which is much slower.  The networking abilities are exposed as TCP/IP connections (we will explore what this means later in the text).
